# Classroom Workstation Reimage
This project addresses Capitol Technology University’s need to have a process for reimaging classroom workstations every semester. The goal is to keep these workstations as up-to-date as possible to minimize security risks and improve students’ learning experience. There are two components to the project: configuring the tool and performing a test deployment in a classroom. The tool that will be used is Windows Deployment Services which is a feature that comes with Windows Server 2016. Other tools can be used to solve this problem, but the chosen tool's advantages are that it's native to Windows and is available at no additional cost. The project's official budget has no direct costs. The project is scheduled to start on January 13, 2020 and finish by March 20, 2020.
