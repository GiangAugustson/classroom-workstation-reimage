# Classroom Workstation Reimage
This project addresses Capitol Technology University’s need to have a process for reimaging classroom workstations every semester. The goal is to keep these workstations as up-to-date as possible to minimize security risks and improve students’ learning experience. There are two components to the project: configuring the tool and performing a test deployment in a classroom. The tool used is Windows Deployment Services. The project was started on January 13, 2020 and completed successfully on March 20, 2020.
